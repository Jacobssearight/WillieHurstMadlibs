Lucy pushed the <pot of gold> open, which immediately set off a <magical explosion> somewhere in the back of the shop. 
She pushed in and almost immediately collided with a tall <MegaGnome> her own size. 
It started to wobble but she managed to stabilize it before it <rages> over.


They <tussle> around the shop. It was actually quite <horrific>, and remarkably long. 
In fact, the <roof> of the shop disappeared way into the <sky>. 
The shop was crammed with all sorts of <rainbow>-looking items. Tall urns. Clocks. 
Decorations of all types. Items of furniture. 
Shelves of dishes, pots and bowls. <Short> seats and couches. It went on and on.
